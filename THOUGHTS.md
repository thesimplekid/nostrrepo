1) It may make more sense to publish some of the information in tags and not in the content. This could allow for better searching on relays. For example the repository name should be a take, issue title etc. 

2) the Repo publisher should be able to add contributors that can close/ moderate issues. Think this can be done similar to issue status. Maybe there is some way to use replaceable events but i think the issues with that is only the event publisher could update (what if original repo publisher steps away from a project/ loses key) and you would lose history.
